        Launch of Web-Based Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) Compliance Monitoring and Reporting System Web Tool
      </h3>
      <p>
        The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funded ‘Partnership to Advance Clean Energy –
        Deployment (PACE-D)’ Technical Assistance (TA) Program, in partnership with Rajasthan Renewable Energy
        Corporation Limited (RRECL), has developed a “Web-Based Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) Compliance
        Monitoring and Reporting System (RPOCS)” for the State of Rajasthan. Idam has supported the Program to provide
        an impetus to the renewable energy (RE) sector in India through the development of RPO Compliance Monitoring
        Framework and Web Tool.
      </p>
      <p> The RPO Web Tool, hosted on <a target="_blank" href="http://energy.rajasthan.gov.in/rrecl">http://energy.rajasthan.gov.in/rrecl</a>, was formally launched at an event on 27
        November 2017, at RRECL Head Office, Jaipur, Rajasthan. RPOCS provides an online platform for all obligated
