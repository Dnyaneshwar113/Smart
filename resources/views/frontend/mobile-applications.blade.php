                <p>Mobile application, most referred to as an app, is a computer

program or software application that is intended to run on a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet PC or a watch. In most cases, mobile applications are developed to be an

interface to the standard web applications. The mobile

application sits between the standard application and the mobile client, and it handles communications between the mobile client and the standard application.

                </p>
