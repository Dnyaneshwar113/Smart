             <h3>Blockchain Based Solutions</h3>

            </div>

            <p>Blockchain is a distributed database system of recording information that shared among the nodes of computer network in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party. The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. In this way, this technology is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be altered, deleted, or destroyed. This’s why this technology is also called Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).</p>

            <p>To align to the changing needs and technology trends in the Energy industry, Idam Infrastructure Advisory Pvt. Ltd., India has 

announced signing of Collaboration Agreement with Power Transition Ltd. (PTL), UK, to devise P2P business models using PTL 

technology in the Indian context.</p>



<p>Peer-2-Peer (P2P) energy trading, facilitated by technologies like Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), have the

potential to transform the energy grid, provide network optimization, manage and track losses. P2P energy trading can enable

anyone to produce and sell energy to their peers, thus disrupting the traditionally centralized and heavily regulated energy

sector across the world. PTL’s technology is unique in that it is built on the Hedera Hashgraph DLT network already used by the

Australian banking system (EFTPOS), selected for speed, low cost of transaction and ultra-low carbon footprint which is scalable

and ideally suited for the energy sector.</p>
