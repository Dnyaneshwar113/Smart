      <h3>Idam Infra partners with Energy Exemplar to bring ‘State of the Art’ modelling tool PLEXOS to India</h3>

      <p> The Government of India (GOI) has announced massive target of 450 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. These goals are in line with India’s commitment under Paris Agreement. Integration of such a massive amount of variable renewable energy (RE) is going to pose challenge to Indian power system. India needs ‘State of the Art’

        planning tools to be able to manage this energy transition from coal dominant power system to RE dominant power system. Recognising this need, Idam Infra has

        partnered with Energy Exemplar to bring the ‘State of the Art’ energy modelling tool PLEXOS to India.</p>

      <p>Through this collaboration, Idam Infra will leverage its extensive experience in

        energy and utilities domain in India and Energy Exemplar will bring its modelling

        capabilities and data sets to support Indian planners and power sector companies in theimplementation of PLEXOS. This partnership reflects the shared commitment of

        both companies towards increased penetration of RE integration and cost

        optimization through analytical solutions offered by PLEXOS.</p>
