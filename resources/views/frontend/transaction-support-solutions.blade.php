        <h3>ReComply </h3>
      </div>

      <p> According to the Electricity Act (EA), 2003 and corresponding policies, the State Electricity Regulatory
        Commission (SERC) has

        specified from time-to-time obligations for the Obligated Entities (OEs) to purchase power from the renewable
        energy (RE)

        sources, which are defined as RPO.</p>



      <p>

        State Nodal Agencies (SNAs) are entrusted with the responsibility of monitoring and reporting the RPO compliance
        of OEs, i.e.,

        distribution companies (DISCOMs), open access (OA) consumers, and captive consumers. RPO compliance monitoring
        is crucial for

        ensuring, the annual RPO targets are met and non-compliance is brought to the regulatorsâ€™ attention in a timely
        manner for

        necessary regulatory punitive action.</p>

      <p> ReComply is a web-based application, which provides online RPO compliance, monitoring and reporting services to
        state agency, DISCOM, open access (OA) consumers and captive power plant (CPP) consumers. Idam Infra in
        partnership with USAID developed

        this IT solution for more than 6 state nodal agencies. This key rationale of this solution is to ensure that RPO
        targets are met and

        simultaneously ensure that regulators are informed about non-compliance in a timely manner for necessary
        regulatory action.

        The other key features of this solution include </p>





      <ul>

        <li> Users can insert monthly data, upload documents, etc. </li>

        <li> Generation of various types of reports with a detailed breakup of conventional and renewable sources</li>

        <li> Online/Offline payment option for solar application fees, meter procurement fees etc.</li>
