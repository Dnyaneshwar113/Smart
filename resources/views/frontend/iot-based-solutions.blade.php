        <h3>IoT Based Solutions</h3>

        <p> Internet of Things (IoT) is an integrated bundle of technologies that connect and exchange data over the
          internet or other communication networks. It is the network of physical devices embedded with sensors,
          actuators, electronics, software, and network connectivity which have the ability to identify, collect and
          exchange the data. It allows the objects to be sensed and controlled from remote point across its existing
          network infrastructure and creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into
          computer-based systems and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit with the added
          merits of minimum human intervention. Now, the organizations can have IoT solutions to solve a business
          operations problem and/or create new organizational value.</p>

        <p><b>WATTGURU<sub>EMS</sub></b> delivers necessary information on energy saving

          measures and assists consumers in slashing their energy bills by

          providing insights into their energy demands, consumption patterns,

          operational efficiencies and leakages.

        </p>

        <p>The domestic and commercial energy prices necessitate the energy

          end users to track high energy loads within their facility. Our data driven WATTGURU<sub>EMS</sub> solution
          analyses the consumers’ energy patterns and examines the electrical and environmental conditions thus,
          providing

          informative energy efficiency measures.</p>



        <p>The implementation of WATTGURU<sub>EMS</sub> is cost-effective and can be

          customized as per consumer requirements.

        </p>





        <p><b>WATTGURU<sub>EMS</sub></b> is Idam’s flagship Internet of Things (IoT) based Energy Monitoring System
          (EMS) solution, which provides a visual information on energy consumption. It lets you monitor your energy
          from anywhere, any time and on any device. It is a web-based solution. So, you don’t need to set up additional
          information and communications technology(ICT) infrastructure in your premises.</p>

          <h3>WATTGURU<sub>TMS</sub> - Intelligent Transformer Monitoring Solutions (TMS)</h3>
        </div>



        <p>WATTGURU<sub>TMS</sub> is an intelligent Transformer Monitoring Solution (i-TMS) developed based on a
          holistic approach to enable continuous monitoring of the power transformer. The solution has been built by
          incorporating Indian and International Standards to predict power transformer’s health regularly.</p>

        <p>Power transformers are one of the most poorly monitored assets in the power sector. The scale of investment
          and operations & management (O&M) cost associated, along with the level of uncertainty and opaqueness
          surrounding the asset, makes it a real pain area for any distribution company (DISCOM).</p>

        <p>The advanced analytical capability of WATTGURU<sub>TMS</sub> will assist DISCOMs in eliminating unforeseen
          failures by continuously monitoring the critical parameters, predicting internal faults, extending asset’s
          life, improving reliability, developing an adaptive testing plan and ultimately improving the revenue
          generation.</p>

        <p>WATTGURU<sub>TMS</sub> can be customized based on existing infrastructure to minimize implementation cost.
